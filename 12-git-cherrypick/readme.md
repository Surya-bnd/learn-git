_git cherry-pick_ is a command in Git that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another branch. It takes the changes introduced by the selected commit and applies them on top of the current branch.

To carry out git cherrypick you have to switch to the master branch and execute the command:
```
git cherrypick <commit-id>
