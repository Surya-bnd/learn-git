`git stash` is a command in Git that allows you to temporarily save changes that you have made in your working directory but are not ready to commit. It provides a way to store your changes in a "stash" and revert your working directory to a clean state, enabling you to switch branches or perform other operations without committing incomplete work.

Here are some commonly used `git stash` commands:

1. `git stash save "<message>"`: Creates a new stash with the current changes in your working directory. You can provide an optional descriptive message to help identify the stash later.

2. `git stash list`: Lists all the stashes you have created, showing their stash index, description, and the branch on which they were created.

3. `git stash apply [<stash>]`: Applies the changes from a stash to your working directory. By default, it applies the most recent stash. You can specify a specific stash by providing its stash index or a unique identifier.

4. `git stash drop [<stash>]`: Removes a specific stash from the stash list. If no stash is specified, it removes the most recent stash.



Using `git stash` allows you to switch branches or perform other operations without committing unfinished work. Once you're ready to continue working on your changes, you can apply the stash back to your working directory using `git stash apply` or `git stash pop`.

Remember that stashing is a temporary solution, and it's important to eventually apply or discard your stashed changes to avoid losing any important work.
